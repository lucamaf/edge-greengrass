# What is Greengrass
IoT AWS Greengrass expands AWS to edge devices so they may process data locally while continuing to use the cloud for analytics, administration, and storage.

Greengrass creates a safe link to the cloud by enabling local device communications via the MQTT protocol. Devices can then connect to the AWS Greengrass Core via the AWS IoT.

IoT AWS works by authorizing the device information to be filtered, Greengrass may be configured to let just the necessary information be broadcast back into the cloud.
